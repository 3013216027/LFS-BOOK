+    <para>In general, the LFS editors discourage building and installing static
+    libraries.  The original purpose for most static libraries has been made
+    obsolete in a modern Linux system.  In addition linking a static library
+    into a program can be detrimental.  If an update to the library is needed
+    to remove a security problem, all programs that use the static library will
+    need to be relinked to the new library.  Since the use of static libraries
+    is not always obvious, the relevant programs (and the procedures needed to
+    do the linking) may not even be known.</para>
+
+    <para>In the procedures in Chapter 6, we remove or disable installation of
+    most static libraries.  In a few cases, especially glibc and gcc, the use
+    of static libraries remains essential to the general package building
+    process.  Usually this is done by passing a
+    <option>--disable-static</option> option to <command>configure</command>.
+    In other cases, alternate means are needed.</para>
